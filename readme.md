# 1000ch

Hello, I'm Shogo working as a software engineer in Tokyo, Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ.

I was initially working as a software engineer to develop outsourced enterprise applications. When I was involved in the project to develop a web application, I was very impressed by [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and web technologies. [1000ch/fluent](https://github.com/1000ch/fluent) is my first OSS, it is the jQuery-like library from scratch. From that time, I have been focusing on all of the web stuff and related OSS.

I actively create and maintain some toolings in my repositories and some organizations. You can see [npm packages over 100](https://www.npmjs.com/~1000ch) and [macOS applications](https://github.com/1000ch?tab=repositories&q=macos) that I maintain. I'm still not sure how you get a benefit and value my OSS contributions, but your sponsoring will definitely help me more dedicated to OSS.
